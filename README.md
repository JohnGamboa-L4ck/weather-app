# Weather App

A weather forecast site using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

**Live Demo:** [https://mrjgamboa.github.io/weather-app/](https://mrjgamboa.github.io/weather-app/)

## Description

This online app was built to complete the "[Project: Weather App](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app)" from the [Javascript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The objective is to strengthen what I learnt in the "[Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript#asynchronous-javascript-and-apis)" section.
